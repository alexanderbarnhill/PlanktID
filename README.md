# PlanktID
Plankton identification and classification for the [National Data Science Bowl](https://www.kaggle.com/c/datasciencebowl) Kaggle challenge.

This is first and foremost an attempt at the challenge but also a way of generalizing Deep Learning
experimentation with PyTorch.

## Configuration
The `options.json` file controls all configuration options for training and evaluation

## Training
`main.py` can be run to train the model for classification.
